# Litestar + JinjaX

Explore a simple example showcasing the Litestar framework alongside JinjaX components, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite, HTMX, and Alpine.js.

**Litestar**, which could be seen as 'FastAPI on steroids,' offers
higher performance and a more extensive feature set, backed by a team of dedicated developers.

Inspired by the django-components library, **JinjaX** enables the creation of server-side, decoupled UI
components, allowing for flexible, framework-agnostic development.
